=== Release Notes

*This is a beta release and should not be used in a production environment.*

The focus of SuiteCRM 7.6 is to enhance the functionality of the native
Campaign module.

The first Beta release includes enhancements to the following:

* *Campaign Wizard* - A simplified Campaign Wizard that is easily
understood. Includes an enhanced UI and progress bar.

* *Email Templates* - The ability to add Tracker Links to Email Templates
while creating the template so that they do not need to be created
beforehand.

* *Web To Lead Form* - Web-To-Lead Forms are now HTML 5 compliant for
easier integration with modern Websites.

* *Target List* - Create Target Lists of Contacts based on associated
Accounts. This allows for contact lists to be segmented by Account
properties without the need to use a report.
